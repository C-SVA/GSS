A full day childcare is a dream,1,Availability (+),,,,,

An affordable on campus option could be helpful for during classes.,1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,Scheduling,Academic Progress,,
An on campus childcare facility would have been extremely nice to lower the cost I’ve been paying and arranging for new childcare when things fall through,1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,Scheduling,,,
"As an institution run by the Church, BYU should hang it's head in shame for it's lack of willingness to offer childcare for students and allow students to fulfill education goals (encouraged by president Hinkley) which will then help them appropriately provide for the families we're encouraged to have. Outrageous.",1,Availability (+),Family Encouragement,Academic Progress,,,
"By not providing childcare for BYU students and faculty on campus, byu unintentionally limits female students in particular. Providing safe, good child care on campus would send a message that we support both families and the pursuit of education for all.",1,Availability (+),Female student support,Family Encouragement,Academic Progress,,
"BYU holds a great value for family and education. There is no doubt in that. But the fact that there is no support for families with kids, it would be hard for mom students like me to progress to get a grad degree...",1,Availability (+),Female student support,Academic Progress,,,
BYU should have at least 8 hours child care for graduate students as most of graduate students have kids.,1,Availability (+),,,,,
"BYU should not be at all responsible for childcare. Students need to arrange that for themselves. If I can't take care of my own needs, it isn't right to expect other people to do it for me. When I do need to ask for help, I should ask my family first, then my church group, then my department.",1,Availability (-),,,,,
BYU should provide a childcare option,1,Availability (+),,,,,
"Childcare is expensive, currently my baby is not in one because we can’t afford it.",1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,,,,
"Childcare is one of the biggest Barrier for women in applying for graduate school, I know MANY women who didn't apply because they didn't have childcare options",1,Availability (+),Female student support,Graduate dissuassion,,,
"Childcare is very expensive and it would be great if there was financial aid or grants to help student parents who need childcare because they don't have family close by, spouse's schedule isn't flexible, etc.",1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,Scheduling,,,
Childcare is wrapped up with funding/financials. If you’re spouse is taking care of the child then you’ve gotta provide the money as well as going to school.,1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,,,,
Childcare needs for spring break don’t align with time off at school.,1,Availability (+),Scheduling,,,,
"Childcare-related, there aren't (as far as I'm aware) any Mother's rooms in the JFSB and it can be inconvenient to go to another to find a Mother's rooms when I need to pump while my child isn't with me.",1,Availability (+),Mother's rooms,,,,
Could there be a closer childcare facility to the tanner?,1,Availability (+),,,,,
Currently don’t have kids but I hope there is a good system in place if I do within the 5 years or that I am in the PhD program,1,Availability (+),,,,,
Daycare,1,Availability (+),,,,,
"Daycare is extremely expensive. The constant need for daycare has caused my degree progress to slow. Considering the Church's emphasis on family, it is very disappointing that BYU does not provide an affordable daycare service.",1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,Family Encouragement,,,
Designating a nearer space to the Tanner building for childcare would be very helpful.,1,Availability (+),,,,,

Essential.,1,Availability (+),,,,,
Exceptions for students who have children need to be made easier.,1,Availability (+),Accommodation & Faculty support,,,,
"Finding last minute sitters is darn near impossible. I wish teachers were more willing to provide Zoom links for parents with sick kids or sick nannies. I also would love an on campus childcare option that was affordable! $17/hr is super expensive, and it isn't even all the hours I really need to study enough during the day hours. Almost all of my student loans go to paying for childcare.",1,Availability (+),Accommodation & Faculty support,Financial Barrier,,,

Having a stipend to help fund childcare would make it more feasible for us to go to school while making sure our children are well taken care of,1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,,,,
Having childcare as an option would open the door to many people applying who currently do not have the option to.,1,Availability (+),,,,,
Having scheduling work in favor of class times. Ex: if class is still going and doesn’t get out until 15 after the hour have daycare open until class is out.,1,Availability (+),Scheduling,Academic Progress,,,
I am bit struggling on childcare as my child can’t school until age 5 and he is 3 now but I’m working on early essential childcare but is taking forever,1,Availability (+),,,,,
"I am currently in a daytime graduate program (not an executive program). One of the required classes this semester is taught in the evening because the instructor is an administrator and, therefore, is not allowed to teach during the day. I understand the conflict. However, if an exception is to be made, I feel an administrator should be allowed to teach at 8am as originally scheduled rather than making the exception to have an entire cohort of daytime students attend an evening class.",1,Availability (+),Scheduling,Academic Progress,,,
I am currently pregnant and I don’t know what resources there are to support graduate students with children. They are not widely advertised in the sciences so I am unaware of their availability.,1,Availability (+),Information,,,,
"I am currently pregnant, expecting a child in two weeks! So I have a child, but don't currently need daycare. If I was going to be in grad school, I would need a lot of child care and having that be offered by the university is something I'm looking into for my PhD program. Frankly, those universities without daycares or without accessible daycare nearby are not on my list of those to apply to.",1,Availability (+),Female student support,Graduate dissuasion,,,
I am not familiar with it.,1,Information,,,,,
I am pregnant and would love to have a discount to childcare programs!,1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,,,,
I am really not sure how much of an issue this is. It certainly could be a big deal and I just don't know about it.,1,Information,,,,,

I believe a childcare program would go a long way to help those that need it.,1,Availability (+),,,,,

"I can imagine that if I did have children, having childcare available would be extremely beneficial.",1,Availability (+),,,,,
"I can’t afford childcare as a single mom, full-time student. I purchased gabb phones for my children, which came out to about $500 out of pocket and cost about $50 a month (cheaper than childcare), but I wish there was some sort of child care stipend available so that I could hire somebody to stay with my kids when I can’t be there (especially when I am gone all day Saturday because I have classes those days too). My kids are 9 and 12 years old.",1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,Female student support,Single Parent,,
"I can't afford to pay for it, so my wife (working parent) and I just take care of it at the expense of my studies.",1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,Academic Progress,,,
I do not have any kids so no,1,NA,,,,,
"I do not have children, but part of that decision was because BYU does not support mothers. The lip service for the family unit and continued education is at direct odds with the actions of the university.",1,Availability (+),Female student support,Family Encouragement,,,
I do not know much about childcare.,1,Information,,,,,
"I do not personally have children, but I think that finding childcare services during the business day is a big concern for many graduate students, especially in cases where the child is very young or both spouses are graduate students.",1,Availability (+),,,,,
I don't even know if there are childcare options that are specifically connected to BYU. It would be useful if that information was more obvious.,1,Information,,,,,
I don't have any kids myself but I do help my friend in our MSW cohort with childcare once a week. It's a HUGE stressor for her and she has to run round town everyday she has classes to get her child to the right house for childcare as she has to split the time up among family and friends who can help during the school day. It's stressful each semester as her schedule changes and she needs to find new sitters sometimes to accommodate for the new schedule.,1,Availability (+),Scheduling,Mental Health,,,
"I don’t have any kids, but as for my classmates who do I know childcare can be a challenge or stressor.",1,Availability (+),Mental Health,,,,
"I don't have any kids, but I imagine it would be super expensive to get childcare with the long days we often have as grad students. I am often at the comprehensive clinic from 8am-7pm and that would add up if I were paying someone to watch my kids!",1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,,,,
I don't have children,1,NA,,,,,
I don’t have children,1,NA,,,,,
I don’t have children at this time but if I did (and didn’t have an outside job) I imagine finances and everything around children would easily be my biggest concern and would be a pretty large deterrent for me attending graduate school,1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,Graduate dissuasion,,,
I don't have children but some of my friends do and I know it would be helpful if the university offered day care services,1,Availability (+),,,,,
I don't have children so I can't say,1,NA,,,,,

"I don't have children, but I know so many people who do and they have to juggle so many things. Childcare, with proper training and supervision of caretakers (not just hired babysitters), would really help the graduate experience",1,Availability (+),,,,,
"I don’t have children, but maybe a place to drop them off near the Tanner building would be helpful",1,Availability (+),,,,,
"I don't have kids but I plan on having them while a student, so providing more information about what childcare services BYU provides. Possibly a respite center for single-parent students?",1,Availability (+),Information,Mental Health,Single Parent,,
I don't have kids so I feel like my opinion wouldn't be incredibly helpful,1,NA,,,,,
"I don't have kids yet, but among my colleagues who do in graduate studies, i know balancing childcare with all the other responsibilities is very hard.",1,Availability (+),Mental Health,,,,

I don't have kids.,1,NA,,,,,
I don't know because I don't have children.,1,NA,,,,,
I don’t know of any childcare support for graduate students,1,Availability (+),Information,,,,
"I don't know what options there are for childcare, but I know that I have classmates that often bring children to classes. They are usually really tactful about it so that they don't distract other students, but I can tell that it distracts the parents from class material. I suppose that can't always be helped.",1,Availability (+),Information,Academic Progress,,,
"I don’t want to be callous, but I don’t think children should be in the graduate classrooms.",1,Availability (+),,,,,
I dont know about this,1,Information,,,,,
"I dont think the childcare is advertised enough, my wife is pregnant and we have thought about childcare at BYU but I know nothing about it.",1,Information,,,,,
"I feel very fortunate to have been able to work out childcare to be able to attend my program. The fact the my husband works at home enables us to not have to pay for additional childcare for our older child for when he comes home from school each day until the end of the work day. And, my mother-in-law is able to be there on the weekly Friday early-outs. Without this, childcare expenses would probably double for us.",1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,,,,
I have a cousin who did grad school at byu and really struggled to find childcare for them. Many other universities do have a similar program.,1,Availability (+),Mental Health,,,,
"I have been lucky that my wife has been able to stay home with our child, but options for childcare would be extremely helpful.",1,Availability (+),,,,,
"I have friends who are mothers and fathers and sometimes they have no option but to bring their infant to class. At BYU Hawaii, senior missionary couples walk around caring for infants of parents in classes. Looking forward to having children of my own, I have a hard time seeing how to make my education fit around that.",1,Availability (+),Academic Progress,Family Encouragement,,,
"I have friends with kids and I think having insurance, nursery, or support for their kids will help them lessen the burden and have time for their education.",1,Availability (+),Academic Progress,Mental Health,,,
I have heard from peers that it is practically non-existent and the cost of childcare can be quite exorbitant. I think that the lack of childcare deters many from pursing graduate studies at BYU and instead they look elsewhere.,1,Availability (+),Graduate dissuasion,Financial Barrier,,,
"I have never heard or been told whether or not there is childcare available, and that is something that is making my fiancee hesitant to want to pursue her masters here",1,Availability (+),Graduate dissuasion,Information,,,
I have no children but I guess a place for those who might not have someone to take care of their children would be great especially single fathers and mothers,1,Availability (+),Single Parent,,,,
I have no kids so I don’t know,1,NA,,,,,
"I have seen my peers bring their small children to class. They have handled it well, but I can tell they are under a certain level of stress trying to take notes and watch over their children.",1,Availability (+),Mental Health,,,,
"I have several cohort members with children, and I know that it's difficult for them to either afford childcare or manage class schedules with children. Evening classes with adjunct professors are particularly difficult for the parents in my program.",1,Availability (+),Scheduling,Academic Progress,,,
I have spoken to a few of my friends in graduate studies that do have children and they have expressed concerns about finding affordable childcare in the area. I think it would be helpful to have a potential resources for those new to the area or even childcare offered at BYU.,1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,Information,,,
I hire a nanny to be with my childeren after school while I am in afternoon classes. It would help me for my class hours to mirror those of my children (between the hours of 9-3) so that I am able to be home with them after school,1,Availability (+),Scheduling,Family Encouragement,Academic Progress,,
"I hope there is a more flexible guideline about bringing children into a class. My husband and I are both graduate students and we have 2 young children. We are both international students with limited funds and there are times that we have to miss class because no one is available to watch our kids. Most of our friends are either working or also studying. We have no family around and we can't afford to pay for daycare. When our children are sick, schools won't allow them to come in unless they don't have a fever within 48 hours. There are fall breaks, and spring breaks, where we still have classes. It is very difficult for us, we value our education but our family is our top priority. If there are zoom options, we would really appreciate it. Thank you!",1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,Academic Progress,Accommodation & Faculty support,Scheduling,
"I imagine it’s a big issue for some students, and a non issue for a lot of others",1,NA,,,,,
"I just have a friend who has a baby and she is always having to juggle her baby between sitters in order to have time for everything, including breast feeding and pumping. It is a lot of time and work!",1,Availability (+),Female student support,,,,
I know I have classmates who have had to skip out on class because a babysitter wasn't able to watch their children. Having something that allows them to come to attend class while watching their children would be optimal.,1,Availability (+),Scheduling,Academic Progress,,,
I know several people in my grad program at BYU that have said childcare has been a significant barrier to success in their graduate studies,1,Availability (+),Academic Progress,,,,
"I love my childcare situation but it is pricey for full time. If there was childcare on campus, that would be such a blessing",1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,,,,
"I plan to have children during Graduate school, and would like options for childcare.",1,Availability (+),,,,,
"I really need on campus childcare that is either free or very affordable. If this is not possible, a scholarship or grant for married students to spend on childcare would also be helpful. There also needs to be a more understanding attitude from some faculty when the children need to come with us to campus.",1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,Accommodation & Faculty support,,,
I strongly believe that providing childcare facilities at BYU would both encourage establishing families and improve the lives of students with children,1,Availability (+),Family Encouragement,,,,
I think for those graduate students who have their family insurance from BYU should cover their childcare and health facilities in their parents health insurance and the health coverage should include some more health services like optical services for the married and single grad students. Childcare health coverage should provide basic health examination without any cost whenever needed.,1,Other,,,,,
"I think in general BYU is behind with the times in supporting students in regards to childcare. Having more childcare access would help families, especially women continue to get an education while also balancing family life. It would help women feel like they don’t have to choose between a family and education.",1,Availability (+),Family Encouragement,Female student support,,,
I think it’d be great to provide this service,1,Availability (+),,,,,
"I think it’s important to realize that BYU is an institution for education. It’s job is not to be a daycare, and the university cannot provide every need a human has.",1,Availability (-),,,,,
"I think its pretty ridiculous, with the emphasis that the church places on family, that BYU is one of the only universities in our state that has no childcare options.",1,Availability (+),Family Encouragement,,,,
"I think making it affordable and convenient are the biggest things. It may be a bit difficult to adjust to different schedules. Making sure that childcare employees are trustworthy and not secretly abusive is a big thing, especially because there have been some horrid stories as of late about daycare workers. Maybe allowing a stream for parents to check in every so often would be good",1,Availability (+),Scheduling,Financial Barrier,Other,,
"I think not offering childcare options for BYU students can make balancing family and academics extremely difficult. It can also result in people putting off having children because there is no feasible way to accommodate both, especially if funding for school is not sufficient for the other spouse to not work",1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,Family Encouragement,,,
"I think that grad school can be very demanding, so there definitely is a need for childcare for those who have children.",1,Availability (+),Mental Health,,,,
I think that there is a real need for it. I know there are people in my cohort who have really struggled with the lack of support from teachers and also knowing that some of them are going into more debt to try to cover costs.,1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,Accommodation & Faculty support,Mental Health,,
I think there should be an option for childcare on campus. As someone trying to plan for a family that would open up so many opportunities to have some sort of option for childcare.,1,Availability (+),Family Encouragement,,,,
"I think there should be childcare offered here, especially with the emphasis on families at BYU. I know UVU has a program so maybe basing it off of that",1,Availability (+),Family Encouragement,,,,
I think there should be more Mother's rooms on campus. I have heard fellow female graduate students complaining about that.,1,Availability (+),Mother's rooms,,,,
"I understand that childcare on campus may not be feasible because of regulations, policies, etc. However, having more family friendly places on campus would be helpful so children can occupy themselves while parents switch off or study.",1,Availability (+),Family rooms,,,,
I waited to start grad school until my children were in school.,1,Availability (+),Academic Progress,Graduate dissuasion,,,
I wasn't aware of any childcare offered,1,Information,,,,,
I wish there is byu related childcare under 3 years old or help to find childcare or daycare that has lower tuition,1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,,,,
I wish there was a BYU daycare for Graduate students on campus.,1,Availability (+),,,,,
I wish there were on-campus childcare and that it was affordable.,1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,,,,
I wish there were options for childcare at BYU. It is really challenging to find your own local support for childcare.  And each semester I am scrambling to find new help.,1,Availability (+),,,,,
I wonder if there's a space at BYU where our older children can stay doing homework when we have classes after their school is out.,1,Availability (+),Family rooms,Information,,,
I would be more likely to consider having kids during grad school if good childcare was available for graduate students.,1,Availability (+),Family Encouragement,,,,
"I would just be interested in know more about how to find childcare. That has held me and my family back from having kids while I'm in school, we aren't sure how to find affordable child care.",1,Availability (+),Family Encouragement,Financial Barrier,Information,,
I would like to know what BYU Graduate Studies is currently doing to help with childcare.,1,Availability (+),Information,,,,
I would like to learn more information about childcare for the future,1,Availability (+),Information,,,,
I would love an option for my children to have quality childcare but transportation is impossible.,1,Availability (+),Other,,,,
"I would love if there were some available options during class times. I don't have kids yet, but I might potentially before I graduate",1,Availability (+),Scheduling,Academic Progress,,,
"I would love to have childcare options at BYU. This is the hardest problem that I face when coming to school. Even the preschool and Kindergarten options are difficult because they aren't on the same schedule as my classes. (Classes start on the hour or :15, and preschool has half hour, etc.)",1,Availability (+),Scheduling,Academic Progress,,,
I would love to have the opportunity to have something on campus that would allow me to go into the lab whenever I need to rather than trying to work around the times when someone can watch my child.,1,Availability (+),Scheduling,Academic Progress,,,
"I would love to see on-campus child care services available for BYU students. Considering the large number of students who are married and/or have children at BYU, I'm surprised BYU has not yet provided this service. Please see UM Ann Arbor's program for inspiration as to how to make childcare available to the BYU community.",1,Availability (+),,,,,
I would much prefer to employ a daycare entity organized by BYU than where I'm currently paying.,1,Availability (+),,,,,
I’m barely handling this single with no kids. I don’t know how people do this with whole families.,1,Availability (+),,,,,
I'm not familiar with how BYU Graduate Studies can help with childcare. Are there any services for grad students and their children?,1,Availability (+),Information,,,,
I'm not the right person to ask :),1,NA,,,,,
"I've had several class where people had to bring on their kids. Offering it seems important, especially because the church puts such an emphasis on having families",1,Availability (+),Family Encouragement,,,,

"If BYU could have childcare program for younger kids from 1-3 years old, that will greatly help mother students",1,Availability (+),Female student support,,,,
"If services for this exist, please make this known publically",1,Availability (+),Information,,,,
If the BYU could provide a space where we could leave the kids to play and attend the classes in time of emergency that would be a relief to us rather than worrying how to bring them to class and making them be quiet,1,Availability (+),,,,,
If there are programs that help with childcare market it more as I had no idea.,1,Availability (+),Information,,,,
"If there is a way to accomplish assignments without needing childcare, it would be a great help.",1,Availability (+),Academic Progress,,,,
"If there is insufficient child care for students, students with children will be disadvantaged in their education. Additionally, lack of child care at BYU will deter qualified, potential students from applying and will only serve to diminish diversity and belonging on campus. If BYU and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints really care about families, like they say they do, providing a much greater amount of free and accessible child care for students needs to be a much higher priority.",1,Availability (+),Academic Progress,Graduate dissuasion,Family Encouragement,,
"If there were more reputable options for childcare on campus, it would make an incredible difference to me and my education— both in terms of attendance when childcare doesn’t work and mental ease/lightening the load for my spouse during the long days when I’m away.",1,Availability (+),Academic Progress,Mental Health,,,
If we could have a low prize or free childcare program it will be really helpful,1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,,,,
"If you provide child care, the graduates on the West side of campus (RB, SFH, WCCB, etc) would need access and not everyone can walk up the stairs or even have time to walk up the stairs to “top” campus.",1,Information,,,,,
Is it feasible for Brigham Young University to offer a daycare program with bilingual services?,1,Availability (+),Other,,,,
"Is there  childcare available gor BYU students? I honestly don't know. If BYU has this service, children have to be enrolled the whole semester?

"It doesn't affect me personally yet, but having access to safe and nearby childcare would mean so much to many of my colleagues.",1,Availability (+),No issue,,,,
"It doesn't exist, so you have to plan ahead and either leave your child(ren) at home with a spouse or babysitter or take them with you to campus/classes. It is very difficult to get babies to nap on campus.",1,Availability (+),,,,,
It feels like my spouse is my only option.,1,Availability (+),,,,,
It is a non-issue with my family.,1,No issue,,,,,
"It is difficult for a Single Parent to attend BYU due to a lack of daycare. BYU students could benefit greatly from an on-campus daycare for all ages.

It would be awesome if there are some facilities for people with kids to be able to feed them and take care of some minor chores they can't do it in their own offices,1,Availability (+),Family rooms,Mother's rooms,,,
It would be awesome to get help with childcare at least part time at an affordable rate or free. Honestly that would be a dream. Right now I am having to rely on 6 friends having to rotate my baby from home to home in between classes which makes it really hard.,1,Availability (+),Financial Barrier,Mental Health,,,

It would probably make graduate studies more possible for many potential students.,1,Availability (+),,,,,

Secondly, I did not plan to have a child in graduate school but life happened differently regardless of my planning. Because of this I felt that I would have to drop out of grad school because of the limited resources and feeling like I was a burden on my program.

People in my program had their first kids as grad students and brought them to class. Luckily our professors have been accommodating and welcoming of the kids but I know that it has been stressful for my peers to because they didn't even have the option of daycare on campus (and BYU is supposedly super family-friendly) because the only daycare is so hard to get into to. My friend would have to go to a different building to breastfeed because there were no accommodations in our building.
