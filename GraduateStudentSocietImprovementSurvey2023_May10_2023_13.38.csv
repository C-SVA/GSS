I think that when you enroll you should be emailed a pdf packet of coverage information and frequently asked questions that are up-to-date. That packet should also have information about how to log onto the online portal, something I still have not been able to do successfully. The only real benefit that the student health insurance provides to me now is that I know I at least have insurance. But the comfort that gives me is mostly overshadowed by the fact that I don’t know what the coverage is and I’m afraid I won’t know what to do or say to medical personnel in an emergency.

However, I am relatively healthy and so don't often go to the doctor's office. I would appreciate if there were a BYU dental or vision plan or option. Dental visits are every 6 months for routine care and if you have to do any dental work , things can get expensive quickly. Especially for wisdom teeth removal. That may be more frequent among undergrads given the timing of wisdom teeth growing in. However, I remember being told my senior year of undergrad that I should get my wisdom teeth removed, but the estimated cost was more than 2x my month rent. I don't know if such things are usually, covered under what DMBA might be willing to offer, but if they were, it would greatly improve my ability to actually address health issues as they arise.  Vision is also something should be checked regularly. If I did have vision insurance, they I would also be more likely to actually get the Lasik surgery that my eye-doctor said I would be a good candidate for. As things stand now, I just consider that outside my budget and haven't bothered considering it. Again, not sure if that is something that is usually covered under regular vision plans or not, but even if it is not, having vision checkups or prescription glasses covered would be nice.   I don't think it should be required of students the same way the basic heath care plan is required, but it would be nice if there was an option to add it on. Perhaps there is, and I just don't know it. In which case, having that option be more apparent (easily found in navigation, easy to add, etc) would help.  All of that being said, I do appreciate the ease with which I was able to sign up for BYU insurance. When I aged out of my parents' insurance plan and was going through the process of applying for state insurance, there were so many hoops to jump through with different forms and websites etc. I am really glad that DMBA is so simple to get.

The things I would like to see would be convenience things that make life more doable. For example, more scholarship opportunities, more access to apps through BYU (I know there are a bunch, but no one has ever given me a list of things that are free through BYU; it would be SUPER helpful if that could be made more public/obvious), more free food. That being said, I really am grateful for the experiences I already have at BYU in the grad program."
